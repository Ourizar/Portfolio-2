                My name is Oscar Urizar! Welcome to my portfolio page. I am currently
                enrolled in the GA Tech coding bootcamp and am learning a lot about
                web development. On this page I will be able to showcase my projects
                for you to see. I have worked in the Dental field since I joined the
                workforce, but technology has always attracted me. I have taken the
                leap and am well on my way to becoming a Full-Stack Developer. Please
                navigate through my page to see more about my work, and contact
                information.
              </p>
